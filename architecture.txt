The server can maintain itself until the match is won.  After, it can self destruct and make the players exit the battle.
The server also needs to be a docker image of its own, displayed on the host's machine.

I want the pokemon to be pretty accurate, but for the sake of time, I can pre create a handful of them with a set of four moves.
Each player is randomly assigned one at the start of the game.

The server needs more intelligent data structures to handle game state.  Game logic should live in the server.
Here are things that need to be known:
    Players in game (can come later)
    Pokemon battling in game and their stats

When does a game end?
    When one pokemon runs out of HP (HP < 0)

These structures should be exportable (JSON) to be received and parsed by the client

NEXT STEPS: 
    - Clean up CLI code : IN PROGRESS
    - Create isGameOver endpoint and finish handling bool response
